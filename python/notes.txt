TODO
-get the quad solver simple case working! [done!]
-get started on the GUI

4/8/2016 Notes
TODO
-interaction methods to add for beams:
	-should be able to position it by any joint
	-should be able to rotate it about that joint
	-hmmm... but how to do this elegantly?
	-still possible that there are two cases: point at and point away
	-we should do orientation by two joints, b/c everything else "solves" after those to joints are in place.
-add a beam interaction testing UI [done]

4/7/2016 Notes
TODO
-write unit tests for all math2d functions -> looks like radd and rsub aren't really needed [done enough]
-write the snap and orient method for beams. write a graphical test for this with mouse interaction
-test quad solver

Thoughts
-should we... restructure everything to be like a 2D skeleton?
-and specify where things have to be joined?
-or can we auto-build a 2D skeleton from a set of joints?
-it's hard to tell without a UI
-but I think my existing solution is actually more flexible

-solver currently breaks on line 118 in solve quad because getCommonJoint is returning None
-thought: when solving a beam, need to reposition it relative to a joint
	-this applies to orientation as well as position!
	-TODO: implement and test
